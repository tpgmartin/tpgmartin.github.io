Something a bit different! My latest blog post is from the transcript for my lightning talk I will deliver at [Infiniteconf 2018](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/9780-infiniteconf-2018-the-conference-on-big-data-and-ai) in July. This is available to read now on [medium](https://medium.com/skills-matter/the-why-of-data-driven-organisations-64b2e6a38402). See you there!

All the best,

Tom
